Base resource::
  The remote resource identified as the entrypoint for an entity's API, identified by the entity's `@RemoteResource` annotation. An entity's base resource may be single-valued or collection-valued.

Entity::
  An artifact within the client-side model. This may correspond to a full or embedded remote resource. Entity types may be concrete classes (Java Beans - when their representation contains data properties) or abstract classes or interfaces (useful when their representation contains read-only links).
