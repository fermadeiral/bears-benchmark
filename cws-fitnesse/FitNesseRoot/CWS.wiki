!1 !-CWS - Cryptographic Web Store-!
Welcome to the !-FitNesse-! Test Suite for the !-Cryptographic WebStore-!, CWS.
This is a simple backend system, which allows storage of data encrypted without
the need for providing Keys, as these are stored internally.

The tests in this Suite, is divided into several sub sections, first is the
section for System Administrators on how to configure the system, following this
comes various Use Cases. All documented and illustrated with multiple testable
examples. It should be noted, that for some of the tests a bit if cheating has
been added, such as storing the Id's generated by CWS in the fixtures and not
added as part of the test results, as they will differ for each run.
