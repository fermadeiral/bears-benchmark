== Building

To build and install into the local Maven repository:

`mvn install`

To run the integration tests:

`mvn verify -PrunITs`

You can run integration tests individually via your IDE by running the `uk.co.blackpepper.bowman.test.server.Application` Spring Boot application from the `test/server` module, then running tests using your IDE's JUnit runner. 

== IDE Setup

A Checkstyle plugin for your IDE is recommended.
