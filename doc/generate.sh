# We have not yet automated generation of the manual. However, it
# should do the following:
#
# 1. Use a DocBook generator to generate manual.html and manual.txt.
#
# 2. Copy manual.html to docs (so that it can appear as
# julianhyde.github.io/sqlline/manual.html)
#
# 3. Copy manual.txt to src/main/resources (so that it will go into
# the jar and can be found via !manual command).

echo Not implemented

# End generate.sh
