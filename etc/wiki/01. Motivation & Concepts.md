# Motivation & Concepts
Based on a discussion on Gitter the idea of creating Nalu was developed.

The main goal is to create a tiny and simple to use application fraemworkwith the following characteristics:

* Fully support of the browser's back- forward- and reload-button.

* An optional loader that will be executed at application start to load data from the server.

* A client side context, router and event bus which will be automatically injected in every controller. (Handler have only access to the context and the event bus)

* Filters to intercept routing.

* Full history support.

* Seperation of views into a controller and a component with framework sided instantiation.

* A controller life-cycle using ```start```-, ```mayStop```- and ```stop```- similar to GWT Activities.

* Supports HTML links and programmatically routing thanks to a router.

* Controller based handler manager, that will remove all handlers from the event bus in case the controller is stopped to prevent memory leaks (handler registrations must be added to the manager).

* Support for UiBinder (nalu-plugin-gwt)

* Nalu composites to support smaller classes

* Controller & component caching

* Component creation inside a controller to support GWT replacement rules and static factory methods

## Basic Idea
The basic idea of Nalu is to use a String to route (will be called 'route') between sides. In the context of a web application this is done using a hash which gets added to the url. Because of the fact that every controller in Nalu is related to a route, Nalu is able to identify a controller, create it and add it to the DOM.

Parameter are added to the route, so there is no need to create a place (like it is necessary in GWT's Activities & Places). In case Nalu identifies a controller, it will inject the parameters.
