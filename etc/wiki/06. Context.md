# Application Context
The application context is a class, which will be instantiated by the framework and injected in every controller, filter, handler and the loader. All controllers, handlers, filters and the loader will have access to the same instance.

This is a good place to store informations taht shoudl be application wide available.

The context is a required attribute of the ```Application```-annotation.

```Java
@Application(loader = MyLoader.class,
             startRoute = "/application/search",
             context = MyApplicationContext.class)
@Shells(@Shell(name = "application",
               shell = ApplicationShell.class))

interface MyApplication
    extends IsApplication {
}
```
