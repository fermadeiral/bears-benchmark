BPjs Execution Runtime
----------------------

This program takes a series of BPjs files, and executes or verifies them 
as a single BProgram.

Use "-" to also read from stdin.

BProgram log and event sequence are written to stdout.

Switches:
   -v ("verbose")
        Print more data about the BProgram's status as synchronization points.
   --verify 
        Verify the program, rather than execute it.
   --full-state-storage (verification only)
        Use full state storage, rather than a hashed one.
