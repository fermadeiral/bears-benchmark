Unification of Prolog Terms
<p>
Unification is the process of matching Prolog terms.
The rules for determining if two terms are unifiable are as follows
<ul>
<li>Atoms unify if and only if they are the same atom.</li>
<li>Numbers unify if and only if they are the same number.</li>
<li>Structures unify if and only if 
they have the same functor, they have the same arity (number of arguments) and their arguments unify.</li>
<li>An <i>uninstantiated</i> variable will unify with any term. 
As a result the variable will become <i>instantiated</i> to the other term.</li>
<li>An <i>instantiated</i> variable <code>V</code> will only unify with another term <code>T</code>
if the term <code>V</code> is <i>instantiated</i> to will unify with <code>T</code>.
</ul>
