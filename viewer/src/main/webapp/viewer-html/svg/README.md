# SVG naming convention
- Names should always be lowercase
- For components the name of the SVG icon should be the class name without the viewer.components part (for example: viewer.components.DataSelection -> dataselection.svg)
- For tools the name of the SVG icon should be the css-class from OpenLayers (for example Measure Tool -> olcontrolmeasure.svg)
