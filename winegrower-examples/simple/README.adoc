= Apache Winegrower - Simple example

This example is the minimum application you can create with Winegrower.

Your application is a regular jar with a Winegrower activator entry point (a class annotation with `@ImplicitActivator`).

NB: this simple example is not OSGi compatible, it only runs with Winegrower.

== Dependencies

The only dependency you need is `winegrower-core`.
